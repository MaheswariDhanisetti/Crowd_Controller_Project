## Overview
Welcome to the Population Control System project! This digital circuit is designed to control population in high traffic areas by providing clear analysis and alerts.
It displays the current population count on an LCD screen and sets a maximum limit based on the area's density. When the count reaches the maximum limit, the system indicates that the area is full.
Additionally, if someone attempts to enter the area beyond the maximum limit, the system alerts with an overcrowding message and activates a buzzer for further alerting.

## Project Components
The system is built using Arduino UNO, a popular prototyping board, and various components:
IR sensors: Detect individuals entering the area.
16x2 LCD display: Shows the population analysis.
Buzzer: Provides audible alerts.
Potentiometer: Adjusts parameters such as current, voltage, and LCD brightness.
Power Supply: Arduino is powered by a 9V DC adapter, while other components receive power (5V or 3.3V) from the Arduino as required.

## Functionality
The Arduino Sketch running on the device implements several functionalities:
Reading sensor data.
Converting data into strings.
Displaying data on the character LCD.
The Sketch is written, compiled, and loaded onto the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
